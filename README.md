### Overview of the project activities

2020-2024  

Accelerate digital transformation with turnkey solutions and differentiated pricing.  
Systems are built end-to-end for customers, which are easy to integrate into current business processes.

#### Competition analysis

In a complex analysis, direct and indirect compounds and their strengths and weaknesses will be identified.  
Direct general sells the same products to the same target range as us, while indirect general sells to different target range.  
Complex products depend on many service providers.  
Common third-party service providers include software services such as web hosting platforms, marketing agencies, analytics software, and other software.  
As technology analysts point out, rising costs for third-party services outweigh more than mere inflation.  

#### Resource management of a project

The contributions of the participants come mainly from resources. Resources are equivalent to local servers, buildings, and other infrastructure used, and also to the production input generated by developers and marketing companies during the project period.
Resource Allocation is the process of identifying available resources such as people, time, money, facilities, and allocating projects based on team availability, skill set, and interests. Resource allocation is done by the project manager and team leader.

#### Challenges and risks

The project was carried out in two different phases.  
Phase 1 was abandoned in less than six months due to the focus on a change in technical policy.  
Phase 2 is designed to provide more direct assistance to businesses and local marketing organizations.  
The Project Manager assessment showed that the Phase 1 approach did not achieve the desired results,  
resulting in Phase 2, the final design that focuses again on individuals as producers and the organisation as marketing officers, was determined.
